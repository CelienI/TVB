# TVB
Thesis

PSE_13-01:
- parameter space exploration
- based on https://github.com/AmoghJohri/TVB-Tests/blob/master/fullTesting_legacy.py 
- (not actually used further)

State variable I.ipynb
- script that looks at amount of inhibition in four differnet simulated models
- plot the I variable of the four models in one graph to compare inhibition levels 

FFT_loops.ipynb
- script that loops over interesting regions 
- for each region, the time series is computed for both the healthy and the depressed model in one plot
- for each region, the FFT is computer for both the healthy and the depressed model in one plot
- currently based on simulations of 3 seconds, will increase that!
