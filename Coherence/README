Script to compute t.test between (mean) coherence from 100 brains per group

COHERENCE_100sims script.ipynb
- script compares all ROIs across all four groups (Healthy, depressed, HF-rTMS, LF-rTMS)
- cannot run it on my computer, loading more than 200 simulations in one script gives a memory error 

COHERENCE_100sims_Dep_Health.ipynb
- same as general COHERENCE_100sims script, but here only compares healthy with depressed group
- in later scripts, I will compare other groups 




UPDATE 30/04/2021

- scripts actually used:
  - HF_100simulations with coherence_original.ipynb
  - LF_100simulations with coherence_original.ipynb
  - Depressed_100simulations with coherence_original.ipynb
  - Healthy_100simulations with coherence.ipynb
  - Dealing with vstacked coherences-4 brain types_with EF.ipynb (includes effect sizes and adjusted p-values)
