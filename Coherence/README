Script to compute t.test between (mean) coherence from 100 brains per group

COHERENCE_100sims script.ipynb
- script compares all ROIs across all four groups (Healthy, depressed, HF-rTMS, LF-rTMS)
- cannot run it on my computer, loading more than 200 simulations in one script gives a memory error 

COHERENCE_100sims_Dep_Health.ipynb
- same as general COHERENCE_100sims script, but here only compares healthy with depressed group
- in later scripts, I will compare other groups
